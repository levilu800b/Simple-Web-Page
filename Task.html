      <h2 style="color:blue">What is HTML?</h2> 
      <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is used to format web pages. HTML consists of a set up markup 
        <b>tags</b> that describe different elements of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks. 
        The tags generally come in pairs, and are placed at the beginning and end of the text they are describing. 
        <b>Start tags</b> are denoted by <> and <b>end tags</b>
      are denoted by &lt;</>/&gt;. For example, the text between &lt;p&gt; and &lt;p/&gt; describes a paragraph.</p> 

      <h2 style="color:blue">Creating a HTML Document</h2> 
      <p>You can easily create simple web pages in Word by just saving a 
        Word document as a web page. However, for full functionality and control, itâ€™s best to use a simple 
        text editor such as Notepad in Windows.  All HTML documents begin with a DOCTYPE declaration that defines 
        the document type followed by <HTML> and <body> to indicate that this is a web document, and visible page content, respectively. 
        Headings are denoted by levels, H1 is the highest level of heading, H2 is the next highest heading level, and so forth to H6.</p>  

      <h2 style="color:blue">Formatting Tags</h2> <p ondblclick="this.style.fontSize='25px';">Text within the body of the 
        HTML page need formatting tags to add bolding, italics, or other effects. For example, to bold text, use the tag &lt;b&gt; 
        and to <i>italicize</i> text use the tag &lt;i&gt;. Colors are represented as a style element, and further defined by a color name or 
        a HEX code. For example, the headings in each paragraph are formatted as blue. Links to other web pages are defined with 
        the &lt;a&gt; tag.For more information on creating HTML pages work through this<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">

      <h2 style="color:blue">Viewing an HTML Page</h2> <p id="parThree">After the HTML page has been created, you can view the 
          HTML Page in your browser by simply navigating to the saved HTML document and double clicking it.</p>

          <h1> Unix Shell </h1>

     <h2 style="color:blue"> What is a Unix Shell </h2>
          <p> It consists of both Command Line I nterface (CLI) and scripting language. The Shell Used by Unix is called 
              Bash (Bourne again Shell) is best used on this for a better understanding. Less obvious how to perform 
              tasks but allows powerful automations and also useful as a programmer for managing flies and automating 
              some basic tasks.</p>

     <h2 style="color:blue"> How to list the flies in a Directory </h2>
     <p> Use the ls command to display the contents of a directory.
         The ls command writes to standard output the contents of each specified Directory or the name of each specified File, 
         along with any other information you ask for with the flags. If you do not 
        specify a File or Directory, the ls command displays the contents of the current directory.
        By default, the ls command displays all information in alphabetic order by file name. If the command is 
        executed by a user with root authority, it uses the -A flag by default, listing all entries except dot (.) 
        and dot dot (..). To show all entries for files, including those that begin with a dot (.), use the ls -a command.</p>
    
     <h2 style="color:blue"> How to show and change the working directory </h2>
     <p> First list the flies in your current directory by using ls command. Then print out the directory of were you are working on
          now by using the pwd command(print working directory) and it will display or show were you are working on at the moment. 
          Use the cd command to move from your present directory to another directory. You must have execute (search) permission in 
          the specified directory.
          If you do not specify a Directory parameter, the cd command moves you to your login directory ($HOME in the ksh and bsh 
          environments, or $home in the csh environment). If the specified directory name is a full path name, it becomes the current 
          directory. A full path name begins with a slash (/) indicating the /(root) directory, a dot (.) indicating current directory, 
          or a dot dot (..) indicating parent directory. If the directory name is not a full path name, the cd command searches for it 
          relative to one of the paths specified by the $CDPATH shell variable (or $cdpath csh variable). This variable has the same syntax 
          as, and similar semantics to, the $PATH shell variable (or $path csh variable).
          
          The following are examples of how to use the cd command:
          To change to your home directory, type the following:
          cd
          To change to the /usr/include directory, type the following:
          cd /usr/include
          To go down one level of the directory tree to the sys directory, type the following:
          cd sys
          If the current directory is /usr/include and it contains a subdirectory named sys, then /usr/include/sys becomes the current directory.
          To go up one level of the directory tree, type the following:
          cd ..
          The special file name, dot dot (..), refers to the directory immediately above the current directory, its parent directory.</p>

     <h2 style="color:blue"> How to create a new directory </h2>
     <p> Use the mkdir command to create one or more directories specified by the Directory parameter.
         Each new directory contains the standard entries dot (.) and dot dot (..). You can specify the permissions 
         for the new directories with the -m Mode flag.
         When you create a directory, it is created within the current, or working, directory unless you specify an absolute 
         path name to another location in the file system.
         The following are examples of how to use the mkdir command:
         To create a new directory called Test in the current working directory with default permissions, type the following:
         mkdir Test
         To create a directory called Test with rwxr-xr-x permissions in a previously created /home/demo/sub1 directory, 
         type the following:
         mkdir -m 755 /home/demo/sub1/Test
         To create a directory called Test with default permissions in the /home/demo/sub2 directory, type the following:
         mkdir -p /home/demo/sub2/Test
         The -p flag creates the /home, /home/demo, and /home/demo/sub2 directories if they do not already exist.</p>

     <h2 style="color:blue"> How to create and remove files. </h2>  
     <p> To create a file you use nano command.
        The following are examples of how to create a file:
        To create a new file called Test in the current working directory with default permissions, type the following:
        nano text.txt
        To create a file called Test with rwxr-xr-x permissions in a previously created /home/demo/sub1 directory, 
        type the following:
        touch file.txt
         To remove file  you use the rm command. rm -ir
        <b> <br>NOTE: By using the command or flag always remember that it might not apply in all operating system. 
            Each operating system have a command that their all understand and use.</b>  </b></p>

      <h1> GitHub Workflow </h1>

      <h2 style="color:blue"> What is GitHub? </h2> 
      <p> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together 
          on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, 
          branches, commits, and Pull Requests. This video about GitHub can help you understand 
          more about what GitHub is all about<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E"> GitHub Video </a> </p> 

      <h2 style="color:blue"> What is a Commit? </h2>
      <p> A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to 
          save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific 
          changes commited along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description
           of what changes were made.</p>

      <h2 style="color:blue"> What is a branch? </h2> 
      <p> The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays
           the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, 
           or which commit led to a particular bug.</p>

      <h2 style="color:blue"> What is a pull request? </h2> 
      <p> Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by 
          a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
      <b><br>NOTE: We cannot talk about GitHub without knowing what a repository and Git is all about. A repository is the most 
        basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project 
        files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and 
        can be either public or private.
       Git is a free and open source distributed version control system originally developed by linus to manage changes
        to the linux kernel.</b></b></p>
